# CaptureNotes Privacy Policy

This is an open source Android app developed by Thomas Triplett.  The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT License; the app is also available on Google Play Store.

It's annoying when apps collect data without your knowledge, CaptureNotes is not one of those apps.

I programmed this app to store all data (notes) on your device and, if you opt for it, in your selected Google Account's Google Docs.

Any data created on your device can be clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.  Any data sent to Google Docs can be erased by deleting the uploaded documents.

If you choose to capture notes from a recording, the audio recording will be sent to Google Cloud Storage for transcription.

The recording is accessible only through a private Google Cloud account and will be deleted 1 day after being uploaded (I would've set it to delete sooner, but lifecycle rules won't allow any earlier time).

If you have any concerns or questions, please send me an email and I will get in touch.

Sincerely,

Thomas Triplett

Normal, IL
