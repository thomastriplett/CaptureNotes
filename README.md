# CaptureNotes
### Typed up notes at the push of a button!

This is an updated version of the CaptureNotes app I originally developed for the MadHacks 2018 Hackathon.

## What are the changes?
This version of the app uses the latest version of Android Vision included in ML Kit, which provides the user with better text recognition than before.

The user can now look at, edit, and delete notes they've already saved.

The speech recognition feature was removed due to the impracticality of using a smartphone mic to record a lecturer.
