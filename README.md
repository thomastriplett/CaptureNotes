# CaptureNotes
### Typed up notes at the push of a button!

This is an updated version of the CaptureNotes app I originally developed for the MadHacks 2018 Hackathon.

## What are the changes?
This version of the app uses the latest version of Android Vision included in ML Kit, which provides the user with more accurate text recognition than before.

The user now has the option of sending notes to Google Docs instead of only saving the file to their device.

The user can now look at, edit, and delete notes they've already saved.

The speech recognition feature was updated to use Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, which allows the user to record longer and more accurately than before.

The app has been redesigned for a more visually-appealing experience
